### Education
- **K. N. Toosi University of Technology** (Oct 2020 – Jun 2022)
  - :mortar_board: Master of Science - MS, Artificial Intelligence
  - During my academic journey, I actively engaged in various activities:
    - :computer: Data Science Enthusiast: My passion for Python as a perfect programming language led me to involve in diverse projects, ranging from web development using Django to data analysis with Pandas and NumPy.
    - :robot: Machine Learning and AI Enthusiast: I immersed myself in the world of machine learning, frameworks such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. Natural language processing (NLP) equipped me with the ability to tackle text analysis and develop text summarization projects.
    - :rocket: Web Scraping: My fascination with web scraping tools like Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium led to the creation of more than 50 automation scripts. By mixing all of the above knowledge (ML-AI-NLP...), I’ve developed three websites that currently serve a community of over 700,000 users.

### Licenses & Certifications
- :certificate: IEEE Certificate of Deep Learning: Applications & Tools workshop - IEEE (Issued Mar 2021)

### AI Researcher - کلاغ (Sep 2021 – Present)
I am thrilled to introduce you to "کلاغ", which means "crow" in Persian, a groundbreaking website that I've developed with the help of :robot: Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the way news is analyzed and delivered. کلاغ is more than just a name; it represents my mission to bring intelligence and automation to the world of news. This innovative platform allows users to choose their preferred news categories and then, with the help of advanced ML and AI algorithms, we analyze and categorize news articles in real-time. What sets "کلاغ" apart is its ability to understand user preferences. Once users have selected their categories of interest, our platform takes care of the rest, automatically sending news articles directly to users who share their interests, right to their inbox. This project embodies my dedication to harnessing cutting-edge technology to enhance the way we consume information. It showcases my proficiency in ML and AI, as well as my commitment to creating solutions that simplify and enrich the lives of users. I invite you to explore کلاغ at both of its URLs:
